    <releaseNotes>Since build 218:
----------------
* win32com.shell
  Add interfaces IFileOperation and IFileOperationProgressSink

* win32com.propsys
  Add interfaces IPropertyChange, IPropertyChangeArray, and IObjectWithPropertyKey
  Add functions PSCreateSimplePropertyChange, PSCreatePropertyChangeArray, and SHSetDefaultProperties

Since build 217:
----------------
* mapiutil.py GetPropTagName has been modified to return the fully qualified
  PT_UNICODE and PT_STRING8 type name. Added optional argument to override
  rawType default in GetMapiTypeName. (Nick Czeczulin)

* Fix the count of replaced terms in Pythonwin's search/replace (rupole).

* Fix obscure issues in the Pythonwin code browser and other uses of the
  "hierlist" widget (rupole).

* Fix a crash using a COM "record" that holds an array (rupole).

* Fix error return in win32gui.GetClassName (rupole).

* Some misc fixed to win32timezone (Jason R. Coombs).

* Some fixes to win32com gencache for Python 3.x (Tim Golden)

* Fix ActiveScript exception hresults.

* RegQueryValueEx now return an empty list for blank REG_MULTI_SZ
  (rupole via bug #3531456)

* Add win32pdh.AddEnglishCounter (rupole via feature request #3529527)

* Fix post_install script use of the registry (rupole via bug #3536122)

* Python 3.3 version is built with VS2010.

* win32com.shell - added function SHCreateStreamOnFileEx and
  interfaces IShellItem2, IEnumShellItems, IApplicationDocumentLists,
  IApplicationDestinations, ITaskbarList, IEnumObjects,
  IKnownFolder, IKnownFolderManager, IObjectArray, IObjectCollection,
  ICustomDestinationList, and IShellLibrary; enhance SHAddToRecentDocs.

* win32com.propsys - Many Property System interfaces and functions added

* pythoncom - added StgCreateStorageEx

* win32com.client -
  Fix iteration of objects that don't declare an enumerator in their typelib
  Validate syntax of constants written to makepy generated files

* win32file - Add GetFileInformationByHandleEx, ReOpenFile and OpenFileById,
  SetFileInformationByHandle.  SetFileTime() has an extra param to allow UTC
  time to be specified.

* win32api - Allow UpdateResource to remove a resource

Since build 216:
----------------
* ISAPI extension works with Python 3.x

* Python service module will now have their directory added to the start
  of sys.path rather than the end to avoid cryptic error messages if a
  module of the same name is already on the path (rvolpe via #3194663)

* Various Pythonwin autocomplete enhancements (kxroberto via #3468282 and
  Oliver Tengler via #3433953)

* The Pythonwin editor now remembers previous searches made in this session.
  (patch #3468280 from kxroberto).

* The LOGFONT struct implementation (win32util) was extended to support the
  full LOGFONT struct as published by Microsoft.  This includes changes to
  win32util.LogFontToDict and win32util.DictToLogFont.  (Feature request
  3433757 by Kris Hardy)

* Remove some duplicated menu code from pythonwin which should avoid
  having py2exe pulling in most of the pythonwin framework in some cases
  (patch 3433527 from kxroberto.)

* A new win32com.client.VARIANT object can be used for advanced control over
  the parameter types passed to some COM methods.  See the documentation in
  win32com/HTML/variant.html (also included in the help file)

* The win32com.adsi and win32com.mapi packages have been upgraded to work on
  Python 3.x and as a result, there is a slight risk that regressions to
  these packages have been introduced in the Python 2.x versions.  Please
  file a bug if any problems are found.

* Pythonwin now warns, but allows you to continue, when saving a file with
  an invalid encoding line (bug 3139486)

* Fix win32com.client.WithEvents on py3k (bug 3199843)

* When passing integers/unsigned integers to COM objects which did not fit
  into 32bits, OverflowErrors were silently discarded and -1 was silently
  passed.  This has been fixed for signed integers (an OverflowError is now
  raised) and unsigned integers now allow for values with the high-bit set to
  be passed correctly.

* Fix win32com.client.WithEvents() on py3k.

* makepy may have generated syntax errors if 'helpstring' elements in typelibs
  had strange quoting or slashes (bug 3199631)

* Fixed that in some cases win32file.GetOpenFileName and GetSaveFileName
  could have returned trailing garbage after an embedded NULL character.
  (bug 3277647)

* Some functions which accepted a DWORD did not accept long integers which
  fit in 32bits with the most signficant bit set (eg, 0x80000000).

* Source-code management moved from CVS to Mercurual.

* win32com.shell - Added SHCreateShellItem and fixed some 64bit issues.

* win32evtlog - Added some of the new event log functions introduced in
  Vista/Windows 7

* win32service - Added EnumServicesStatusEx, and support startup type
  "delayed" for Python services

* win32net - Fix a problem with NetFileEnum on 64-bit (bug #3376041)
