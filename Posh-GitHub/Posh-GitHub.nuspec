to applications / tooling
* Set-GitHubUserName - Adds the username to the current PowerShell session and
sets a global User environment variable
* Set-GitHubOrganization - Adds the organization to the current PowerShell
session and sets a global User environment variable

a date for when the last update (push) occurred, how many open issues and size
* New-GitHubRepository - Creates a new GitHub repository and clones it locally
by default.
* New-GitHubFork - Forks a repository, clones it locally, then properly adds a
remote named upstream to point back to the parent repository.  Aborts if there
is a directory in the current working directory that shares the name of the
repository.
* Get-GitHubIssues - List issues against the repository for the current working
directory, or can list issues against a specific repo and owner.
* New-GitHubPullRequest - Initiates a new pull request to the upstream repo.
* Get-GitHubPullRequests - List pull requests against the repository for the
current working directory, or can list pull requests against all forks from a user.
* Get-GitHubTeams - The default parameterless version will use the GITHUB_ORG
environment variable to get the list of teams, their ids and members.
* Get-GitHubEvents - Will list, in chronological order, the last 30 events that
you have generated
* Clear-GitMergedBranches - Will remove any local branch cruft from branches
that have been merged into the master branch.
