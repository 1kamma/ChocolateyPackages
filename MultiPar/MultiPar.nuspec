    <releaseNotes>
Though there is no noticeable update in this, I plan big update nextly. I must put stable version, before I happen to add many bugs. I plan to improve verification for some special cases in next v1.2.4 tree. The next version's output style won't keep compatibility with older versions. Because I don't update old PAR3 client, you should keep this v1.2.3.3, if you have old PAR3 format files.
 Because default installation path was changed in this version, if you have installed MultiPar by installer package, you should uninstall previous version at first.
