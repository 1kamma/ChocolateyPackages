    <summary>SABnzbd+ open source binary newsreader</summary>
    <description>SABnzbd+ is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python.
It's totally free, incredibly easy to use, and works practically everywhere.
SABnzbd makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an .nzb. SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction.

This installer properly sets up a system service to keep SABnzbd always running in the background and also properly sets up firewall exclusions.

Note that if this is a first time install it will be necessary to configure SABnzbd to allow other computers on your network to access the application.
